A Disney+ Clone I made using ReactJS, ReduxJS and Firebase.
The app features full user authentication functionality and also uses React Router for routing.

Deployed App => https://disney-plus-clone-62db6.web.app/login (not responsive, i.e., open only on a computer)

App designed by -> Clever Programmer (Youtube)

Note - The original app made by 'Clever Programmer' was different and had some bugs which dint allow it to function as expected when deployed, this app improves on that app and adds more functionality and features.
